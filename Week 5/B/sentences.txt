Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards
To be, or not to be: that is the question
Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.
If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything.
